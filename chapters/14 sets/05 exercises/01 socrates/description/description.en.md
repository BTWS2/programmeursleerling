A famous [syllogisme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism){:target="_blank"} says:

> *All men are mortal.*  
> *Socrates is a man.*  
> *Therefore, Socrates is mortal.*

### Assignment

The code block below assigns some sets to variables:
 
- `things`: a `set` of all things (I know a few are missing, but for the sake of argument)
 
- `men`: a `set` of all men (assuming that the first set indeed contains all things)

- `mortals`: a set of everything that is mortal (again, assumingâ€¦)

Using `set` operators and methods, compose Boolean expressions (`bool`) whose
results are assigned to the variables `A`, `B`, `C`,  `D` and `E` to show that
indeed
 
- `A`: all men are mortal

- `B`: Socrates is a man

- `C`: Socrates is mortal

- `D`: there are mortal things that are not men

- `E`: there are things that are not mortal
