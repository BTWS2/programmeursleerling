Write a program that first assigns three sets of numbers between 1 and 1000 (limits included) to the following variables:

- `divisible_by_3`: all numbers that are divisible by 3

- `divisible_by_7`: all numbers that are divisible by 7

- `divisible_by_11`: all numbers that are divisible by 11

Then, it must assign three more sets of numbers between 1 and 1000 (limits included) to the following variables: 

- `A`: all the numbers that are divisible by 3, 7, and 11

- `B`: all the numbers that are divisible by 3 and 7, but not by 11

- `C`: all the numbers that are not divisible by 3, 7, or 11
