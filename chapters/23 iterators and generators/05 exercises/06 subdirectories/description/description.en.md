Write a program that
produces all possible sub-dictionaries from a dictionary, and stores
them in a list. For instance, if the dictionary is `\{"a":1,"b":2\}`,
the program produces `[\{\},\{"a":1\},\{"b":2\},\{"a":1,"b":2\}]` (the
ordering of the list does not matter). Again, use the `itertools`
module.
