Ask the user to enter a
word. Produce all anagrams of that word. If the word contains multiple
copies of a letter, it is acceptable if you produce certain anagrams
multiple times. For example, if the word is `"ape"`, you produce
`"aep"`, `"ape"`, `"eap"`, `"epa"`, `"pae"`, and `"pea"` (in any order).
