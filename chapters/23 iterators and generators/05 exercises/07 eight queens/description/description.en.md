Write a program that
determines how you can place eight queens on a chess board in such a way
that none of them attacks any of the other ones. This is a classic
problem that sounds like it has little to do with this chapter, but when
you consider that you may solve it using the `permutations()` function
in a smart way, you will find that this program can be surprisingly
short.
