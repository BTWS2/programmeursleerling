    <p>After doing the first exercise, together with your partner write down
      exact instructions, in plain English, on how to sort cards under the
      circumstances described above. Get a third person and ask this person to
      take your instructions and follow them, while one of you two takes the
      role of processor. Ask the third person to perform the steps as literally
      as possible, without trying to interpret meaning. This exercise is most
      illustrative if the third person has no idea what the exact function of
      the instructions is. Once the sorting procedure has finished, check if the
      result is correct.</p>
    <p>Your textual description is comparable to a real program. If the third
      person is unable to follow the steps, you seem to have made a syntax
      error. If the person can follow the steps but the end result is not as you
      want, you seem to have made a functional error. When programming
      computers, you will have to deal with both kinds of errors.</p>

      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>Writing such instructions is actually quite hard. Fortunately, writing
        similar instructions in a computer language is easier, as the syntax and
        semantics of the language are well-defined. English, as any other human
        language, is rather unsuitable to write unambiguous instructions.</p>
