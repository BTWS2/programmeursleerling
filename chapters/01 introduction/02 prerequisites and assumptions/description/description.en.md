This book assumes that you have no programming skills at all, but are
willing to learn. You should also have the ability to think in
abstractions.

You should realize that learning how to program might take a significant
time investment. It does not suffice to just read the material and do
the occasional small exercises. You will have to practice with the
material and also do larger exercises, if you really want to gain the
ability to create programs. If you stick to the basic chapters
(everything up to dealing with text files), if you have no programming
knowledge at all, you should count on having to invest between 100 and
200 hours to get to the finish, depending on aptitude. Learning
everything that the book has to offer will take between 200 and 400
hours.

Note that this book will not try to teach you to be a professional
programmer. It teaches the initial skills that any professional
programmer also acquired during his or her education. After teaching
those initial skills, the book ends. For most people, this is enough to
deal with programming tasks they encounter, and provides a sufficient
basis to learn more if there is a need.
