    <p>This is not the only Python book available, although most books that I
      have seen assume quite a bit of knowledge and past experience on the part
      of the student. Books that are aimed at absolute beginners are rare.
      Still, several alternatives for this book, even free alternatives, exist.</p>
    <p>A problem that I have with most Python books aimed at beginners is that
      they attempt to make programming attractive by focusing from the start on
      applications that are immediately useful or entertaining. "Learn Python by
      Programming Games!" is a typical approach that I have encountered.</p>
    <p>Such a setup is misleading. First of all, if you examine a book that
      teaches Python using games, you will discover that the games used are very
      simple word and number games, rather than the next <i>Halo</i>, <i>Civilization</i>,
      <i>Bejeweled</i>, or even <i>Flappy Bird</i>. This generally is not what
      the student would expect from a book on game programming. Moreover, you
      will find that even those very simple "games" are of a complexity that is
      too high to allow a novice to learn programming. I understand that such a
      book tries to evoke enthusiasm among the students by framing its material
      in a way that seems attractive. However, that attraction is lost very
      quickly when students realize that the material is not what they expected,
      and at that point the topics become an obstruction to learning rather than
      a stimulant.</p>
    <p>Regardless which way you look at it, like any other topic of study,
      learning how to program requires studying basic concepts before you can
      advance to more attractive and useful applications. The desire or need to
      learn programming is what should drive the student, not the erroneous
      expectation that they can hammer out a flashy game after a couple of hours
      of studying. That is why I designed this book to start small, with basic
      programming statements, and building knowledge up with a steady pace. The
      book does not remain stuck at the small stuff, however &#8212; if you
      progress through all the chapters, you will be an accomplished programmer
      when you finish it.</p>
    <p>I try to insert exercises that can be entertaining to solve if such
      things appeal to the student. I have had students telling me that they
      really enjoy working on them. However, I have also seen students suffer
      and longing to do something else. Regardless, if you want to learn how to
      program, and do the exercises, the book will teach you everything that you
      need to program any application that you want &#8212; even entertaining
      games if you so desire.</p>
