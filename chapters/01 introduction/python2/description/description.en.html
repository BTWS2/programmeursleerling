    <p>Different versions of Python exist. At the moment of creating this book,
      the most popular versions are Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 is, as can
      be expected, an update of Python 2. Python 2 programs are, unfortunately,
      not completely compatible with Python 3. Since a lot of Python 2 code is
      still in use, Python 2 is still an active language, and still being
      maintained.</p>
    <p>The reason why Python 3 was created is to resolve a number of
      inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies in the Python 2 language. For people
      new to programming, this is a big plus, because there are less "weird"
      language elements they need to learn and understand if they choose Python
      3 instead of Python 2.</p>
    <p>To give an example, when you calculate <samp>7/4</samp> in Python 2, the
      answer is <samp>1</samp>, and not <samp>1.75</samp> as you might expect.
      The reason is that both <samp>7</samp> and <samp>4</samp> are whole
      numbers (integers), and therefore the result of their division is a whole
      number. If you want to make sure that the result is <samp>1.75</samp>,
      you must make at least one of the numbers involved a floating-point
      number. Therefore, <samp>7.0/4</samp> gives the result <samp>1.75</samp>.
      This is how almost all computer languages do calculations. Naturally, for
      people who are not familiar with programming computers, this is
      counter-intuitive. Python 3 has resolved this issue, and automatically
      does the floating-point conversion when a floating-point result would be
      expected, i.e., in Python 3, <samp>7/4</samp> gives the result <samp>1.75</samp>.
      Many Python 2 programs, however, are written with the assumption that
      integer-division rounds down, which means that, when you run them as
      Python 3 programs, they no longer give the desired results. Thus, Python 2
      and Python 3 are not compatible.</p>
    <p>Since Python 3 is more intuitive than Python 2, and since nowadays most
      Python programs and modules have been converted to Python 3, this book is
      written for Python 3. If you ever have to revert back to Python 2, it is
      not hard to make the change. An overview of the differences between Python
      2 and Python 3 is given in Appendix B (which is not a complete overview,
      but contains all the differences that I am aware of). If you are only
      using Python 3, you can ignore this appendix. However, considering how
      often I see the question "What exactly are the differences between Python
      2 and Python 3?", and how hard it seems to be to find an answer to that
      question, I thought it prudent to add it.</p>
