    <p>Python is a general-purpose programming language. This means that it can
      be used for anything and everything you would ever want to do with
      computer languages. Can you therefore conclude that once you have learned
      Python, you will never need to learn another language?</p>
    <p>The answer is that it depends on what you need to do with computer
      programming. While Python can be used for anything, it is not the most
      suitable language for everything. For instance, most game programmers use
      C++ or C\# to create their programs, because these languages produce very
      fast executables, and speed is of utmost importance for games. People who
      create complex statistical models have their own computer languages too.
      Sometimes you need to write programs that interact with other programs
      which require the use of a specific language. And for some problems
      languages with a different philosophy to writing programs are better
      suitable.</p>
    <p>All in all, while Python basically has no limitations as a programming
      language, for specific problems specific other languages might be better
      suitable. Still, for many people Python suffices to do everything they
      need to do for their studies and job. Moreover, Python is a great language
      to learn programming with, and once you understand and can use Python, you
      have a very strong basis to learn any other programming language. That is
      why I believe it is the language of choice to teach programming to
      beginners.</p>
