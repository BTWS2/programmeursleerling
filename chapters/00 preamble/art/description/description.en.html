    <p>Programming is an art form. A teacher of programming in many ways is
      comparable to a teacher of art.</p>
    <p>Most people have had art classes in secondary school. An art teacher
      first teaches about art materials: pencils and paper, different colors of
      pencils, different hardness of pencils, erasers, inks, ink pens, paints,
      and so on. The students use the knowledge acquired to create their first
      drawings. Then the art teacher makes them familiar with art techniques:
      mixing paints to get different colors, special kinds of paints that create
      special effects, combining techniques, how to use perspective, and so on.
      Students get assignments like "draw a cat", and the art teacher assesses
      their results both from the use of materials and the mastery of
      techniques, as well as from an artistic perspective of what makes a good
      likeness of a cat.</p>
    <p>A teacher of programming has similar tasks. At first he teaches students
      about the core principles behind programming languages, basic statements
      that every programming language has, and how these can be used to create
      simple programs. Then he delves into more advanced techniques, by which
      students can construct more complex programs, and can incorporate advanced
      functionalities in easier ways. Students get assignments like "create a
      program that alphabetizes a text", and the teacher assesses their results
      both from their use of programming techniques, as well as from the
      perspective of how well they manage to accomplish the task set.</p>
    <p>From the art teacher's perspective, for an assignment that asks students
      to draw a cat, a student who drew a circle with two triangles on top and
      two dots in the middle, arguably drew a cat but has no grasp of the use of
      materials. A student who hands in a beautiful picture of a tree, may be a
      master of techniques but cannot use them to accomplish a task. And two
      students who hand in the exact same picture of a cat, clearly have been
      plagiarizing. Still, there isn't just one right "cat picture". There are
      many different cat pictures that are acceptable and that show that
      students are learning and becoming artists.</p>
    <p>In the same way, a teacher of programming who gives an assignment, wants
      his students to creatively use the knowledge they acquired to construct
      their own version of a program that solves the task. Students who have not
      mastered the techniques, will be unable to solve the task, or will only be
      able to create a distant approximation of a program that solves the task.
      Students who did master the techniques, may still lack the aptitude of
      combining what they have learned in new and original ways to create a
      solution. And two students who hand in the exact same solution, clearly
      have been copying it and are trying to get away with plagiarism.</p>
    <p>Programming is an art form, where you not only have to master the
      techniques that form the basis of your art, but also have to be able to
      apply these techniques creatively to problems. The main difference with
      producing programs and producing visual art, is that in visual art you can
      still debate about whether an image of a bulldog with pointy ears can be
      accepted as a picture of a cat, while in programming it is much easier to
      disqualify programs as solutions to a particular problem.</p>
    <p>Moreover, everybody knows and realizes that you will never become an
      artist by just studying the materials. You will have to practice, use the
      materials, and develop your skills by applying them to many different
      tasks. In programming, it is exactly the same: you cannot learn how to
      program without writing many programs. Programming not only requires
      knowledge, but also skills that need to be developed in practice, and a
      form of creativity that allows you to expand your abilities to accomplish
      new tasks.</p>
    <p>Naturally, there are few master artists whose work will feature in art
      galleries. But we can all draw pictures of cats, and for most people, that
      ability suffices for their daily needs. In the same vein, there is no need
      for any student to become a master programmer, as long as they can create
      straightforward programming solutions for the problems that they encounter
      in study and work. But be aware that next to mastery of basic techniques,
      creativity is always involved.</p>
