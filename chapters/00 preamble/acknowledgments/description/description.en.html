    <p>Many thanks to Allen B. Downey, who wrote the excellent Python 2 book <a
        href="https://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html" target="_blank"><i>Think
          Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</i></a>. I myself
      learned Python programming from his book, and used the $\LaTeX\$ template
      that he graciously provided as the basis for this book. Downey recently
      released a Python 3 version of his book. If you are already familiar with
      programming in general and just want to get to know Python, his book might
      be the way to go.</p>
    <p>I am grateful to Peter Wentworth, who produced a Python 3 version of
      Downey's book. Peter uses a particular style of teaching that I find does
      not work too well with the students I have had, but I definitely got a lot
      of information from his book.</p>
    <p>Many thanks also to Guido van Rossum, the original creator of Python. I
      love the concept of programming, but very few programming languages are
      actually a joy to use. Python is one of them, and for that I am grateful.</p>
    <p>Thanks also to &#193;kos K&#225;d&#225;r, Nanne van Noord, and Sander
      Wubben, who worked with me on an early version of a Python course, on
      which I later based this book.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the members of Monty Python, whose television shows and audio
      recordings taught me English in a highly enjoyable way. Their show gave
      Python its name, and I have used quotes of their shows in some of the
      demonstrations and exercises in this book.</p>
    <p>Many thanks to Myrthe Spronck, for creating the website for this book,
      found at <a href="http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook" target="_blank">http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook</a>.</p>
    <p>Thanks to all the contributors (listed below) who sent in corrections and
      suggestions.</p>

      assistance with programming problems, of course &#8212; there are plenty
