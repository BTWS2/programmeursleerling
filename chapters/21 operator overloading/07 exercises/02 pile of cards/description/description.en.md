Use the `Card` class as given
above. Now also create a `Drawpile` class. A `Drawpile` consists of a
sequence of cards. The cards are supposed to form a pile with the top
card having the lowest index, and the bottom card the highest index.
Implement the `__len__()` and `__getitem__()` methods. Create an `add()`
method to add a card to the draw pile at the bottom, and a `draw()`
method to remove the top card from a draw pile and return it. Test the
class.
