Using the definitions created in the
previous exercises, create two drawpiles. The first has the 2 of
Diamonds, King of Hearts, and 7 of Clubs (in this order). The second has
the 4 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, and 8 of Spades (in this order). Let the
draw piles play "War!" This game is played as follows: Draw the top card
from each deck. The highest of these cards goes on the bottom of its own
deck, and the other card goes there too. The game continues until there
is only one pile left.

Hint: With this setup, the game will take 13 rounds and the first deck
wins (it has to, as it contains a card that can never be beaten by the
second deck). Do you see what a boring game "War!" is? Why children
insist on playing this – with full decks even – I'll never know.

Note: Normally when "War!" is played there are special rules for when
two cards have the same rank, but in this case the draw piles contain
only cards of a unique rank. You do not have to take into account
playing the game where that can happen, though if you want to do that,
be my guest.
