A `Rectangle` and a `Square` can be
considered shapes. There are, of course, different kinds of shapes which
are defined differently, but share with rectangles and squares that they
have an area and circumference. Define an interface class `Shape`, of
which `Rectangle` and `Square` are sub(sub)classes. Also define a class
`Circle` that you derive from `Shape`.
