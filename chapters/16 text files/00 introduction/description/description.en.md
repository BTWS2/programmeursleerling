One of the most important uses of Python for data processing is the
reading, changing, and writing of text files. Data is often stored in
text files, because text files can be easily transferred between
different programs. There are multiple standardized formats for text
files, such as "comma-separated values" (CSV) files. Python supports
particular text file formats through modules, some of which will be
discussed later. This chapter focusses on opening, reading, writing, and
closing of any text file, regardless of format.
