"Binary files" is the term used to refer to all files that are not text
files. Executable programs are binary files, as are image files, movies,
word processor documents, and many other file types. It is not common to
use Python to process binary files (usually binary files are not handled
by general-purpose programming languages, but by special-purpose
programs), but it is possible. This chapter will explain how to deal
with binary files.
