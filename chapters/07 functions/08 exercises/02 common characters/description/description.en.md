Write a function that gets as parameters
two strings. The function returns the number of characters that the
strings have in common. Each character counts only once, e.g., the
strings `"bee"` and `"peer"` only have one character in common (the
letter "e"). You can consider capitals different from lower case
letters. Note: the function should *return* the number of characters
that the strings have in common, and not print it. To test the function,
you can print the result in your main program.
