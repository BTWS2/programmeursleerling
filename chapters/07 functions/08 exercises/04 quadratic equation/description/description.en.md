you were asked to implement the quadratic formula to solve quadratic
equations. A quadratic equation is described by three numeric values,
usually called A, B, and C. It has zero, one, or two solutions,
depending on the discriminant (the part under the square root). Write a
function that solves a quadratic equation. As parameters it gets A, B,
and C. It returns three values. The first is an integer that indicates
the number of solutions. The second is the first solution. The third is
the second solution. Any of the solutions that do not exist, you can
return as zero. Â
