    <p>To run Python programs, you need a <i>Python interpreter</i>.
      Fortunately, Python interpreters are freely available for almost every
      machine in existence. Visit <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">http://www.python.org</a>
      to download a Python interpreter for your computer. Make sure that you get
      a Python 3 interpreter. Install it. After the installation finishes, in
      principle you are ready to write and run Python programs.</p>
    <p>It does not matter which operating system you use, whether it is Windows,
      Mac OS X, Linux, or something else: you write the same code for every
      machine. You can even take a program that you wrote on one machine and
      copy it to another, which may have a different operating system, and it
      will probably still run as intended (unless the program has some
      system-specific content, but I will get to that in a much later chapter).</p>
    <p>Some Python courses use an online system in which students write Python
      code. That is a possible approach, but it has three disadvantages:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>there are free systems which are very limited and therefore less
          useful;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>there are paid systems which cost money and also have you deal with
          some peculiarities (as they run in a browser);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>at some point you will have to run Python on your own computer
          anyway, so why not start with it?</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>That said, if you prefer to start with an online system and only move
      towards a locally installed version of Python in a later chapter, that is
      certainly possible.</p>
