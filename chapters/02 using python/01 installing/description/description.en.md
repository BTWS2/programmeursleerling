To run Python programs, you need a "Python interpreter." Fortunately,
Python interpreters are freely available for almost every machine in
existence. Visit <http://www.python.org> to download a Python
interpreter for your computer. Make sure that you get a Python 3
interpreter. Install it. After the installation finishes, in principle
you are ready to write and run Python programs.

It does not matter which operating system you use, whether it is
Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, or something else: you write the same code for
every machine. You can even take a program that you wrote on one machine
and copy it to another, which may have a different operating system, and
it will probably still run as intended (unless the program has some
system-specific content, but I will get to that in a much later
chapter).

Some Python courses use an online system in which students write Python
code. That is a possible approach, but it has three disadvantages:

1. there are free systems which are very limited and therefore less useful;

2. there are paid systems which cost money and also have you deal with
some peculiarities (as they run in a browser);
 
3. at some point you will have to run Python on your own computer anyway, so why not start with it? 

That said, if you prefer to start with an online system and
only move towards a locally installed version of Python in a later
chapter, that is certainly possible.
