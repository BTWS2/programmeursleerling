    <p>Besides this book, you might occasionally want to reference the Python
      manual. The easiest way to do that is using the Internet. Just search for
      <samp>Python</samp> with whatever you are interested in, and you will
      quickly see links that lead straight into the Python manuals (the Python
      manuals are stored at <a href="http://docs.python.org" target="_blank">http://docs.python.org</a>).
      You might also run into links that lead you to code that solves a problem
      for you directly. While that is great by the time you have to use Python
      for practical problems, it does not help you to learn. So my advice is
      that you avoid such links while trying to learn programming.</p>
    <p>When you install Python, there usually is a manual installed in a Doc
      folder under the Python folder. You can use it if, for some reason, you
      are not connected to the Internet.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in another book besides this one, I recommend the
      classic <i>Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</i>, by
      Allen B. Downey. It is freely available from <a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/"
        target="_blank">http://greenteapress.com/wp/</a>. A version for Python 3
      was released in 2016. The main differences with my book as far as content
      is concerned, is that my book has more exercises, is aimed more at people
      who are completely new to programming, takes more time for topics that I
      know are hard for students who have no real aptitude for programming, and
      covers a few important topics that Downey's book lacks, such as extensive
      file processing.</p>
    <p>Besides this book and other books like it to learn Python from, there are
      several open video courses available. I do not believe that it is possible
      to learn programming mainly from watching a video. The only way to learn
      programming is by doing.</p>
    <p>I have included a troubleshooting appendix (Appendix A) to explain the
      most common problems that you may encounter during the writing and running
      of programs.</p>
