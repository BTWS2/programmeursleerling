    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><samp>oajns</samp> indicated some spelling mistakes in Chapter 9 and
          in Appendices C and D (fixed in version 1.0.4).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Larry Cali pointed out an error in the code for Exercise 4.3, which
          could give problems with floating-point values which Python cannot
          store exactly. I fixed the exercise and made a remark on this in
          Chapter 3 (fixed in version 1.0.5).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Isaac Kramer noted a problem in Exercise 9.5, which made the issue in
          the code unnoticeable. I fixed this to make the error actually occur
          as I explain in the Answers section (fixed in version 1.0.6).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ruud van Cruchten indicated that my discussion of providing
          multi-line commentary in Chapter 4 was incomplete and could lead to
          problems. I have extended the text in this respect (fixed in version
          1.0.7).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Nade Kang pointed out that the answer to Exercise 7.9 (second
          guessing game) could be confusing. I changed the code a little to
          compensate (fixed in version 1.0.7).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Shiyu Zhang noticed that listing 8.16 contained useless parameters. I
          corrected this (fixed in version 1.0.8).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mustafa Amjed indicated several spelling and logical mistakes in the
          first 100 pages (fixed in version 1.0.8).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Woodgirl Martyr indicated a spelling mistake in Chapter 1 (fixed in
          version 1.0.9).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Claudia Dai pointed out a small mistake in the answer to Exercise
          10.1 (counting vowels; fixed in version 1.0.9).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Several of my students suggested adding flow charts to the chapters
          on conditions and iterations, as they would help understanding of how
          these concepts work. I followed that suggestion (added to version
          1.0.9).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mauro Crociara pointed out multiple typos and gave many ideas for
          improvements (incorporated in version 1.0.11).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Chris Spinks noticed some problems with the answer for Exercise 21.4,
          the extended fruit basket, and the regular expressions in the answers
          to Exercises 25.3 and 25.4, where one is supposed to extract names
          from texts (fixed in version 1.0.12).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Patrick Vekemans noticed an error in the code in Subsection
          \ref{ss:break} (fixed in version 1.0.13).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Jose Perez-Carballo pointed out to me that the list of reserved words
          that I presented was actually the Python 2 list, which has undergone a
          few changes in Python 3 (fixed in version 1.0.13). He also pointed out
          a typo (fixed in version 1.0.14).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Jos Kaats indicated an erroneous detail in the calling of functions
          from functions (fixed in 1.0.14).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Luis Mendo Tomas had quite a few remarks which all lead to changes in
          the book, in particular the inclusion of a section on default values
          for function parameters (version 1.0.14).</p>
