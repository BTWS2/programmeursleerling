Many thanks to Allen B. Downey, who wrote the excellent Python 2 book
*Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist*. I myself learned
Python programming from his book, and used the $$\LaTeX$$ template that he
graciously provided as the basis for this book. Downey recently released
a Python 3 version of his book. If you are already familiar with
programming in general and just want to get to know Python, his book
might be the way to go.

I am grateful to Peter Wentworth, who produced a Python 3 version of
Downey’s book. Peter uses a particular style of teaching that I find
does not work too well with the students I have had, but I definitely
got a lot of information from his book.

Many thanks also to Guido van Rossum, the original creator of Python. I
love the concept of programming, but very few programming languages are
actually a joy to use. Python is one of them, and for that I am
grateful.

Thanks also to Ákos Kádár, Nanne van Noord, and Sander Wubben, who
worked with me on an early version of a Python course, on which I later
based this book.

Thanks to the members of Monty Python, whose television shows and audio
recordings taught me English in a highly enjoyable way. Their show gave
Python its name, and I have used quotes of their shows in some of the
demonstrations and exercises in this book.

Many thanks to Myrthe Spronck, for creating the website for this book,

Thanks to all the contributors (listed below) who sent in corrections
and suggestions.

If you have a suggestion or correction, please send email to
[pythonbook@spronck.net](pythonbook@spronck.net) (not to be used for
assistance with programming problems, of course – there are plenty of
places on the Internet where you can get such help), or leave a message
at the forum <http://www.spronck.net/forum>{:target="_blank"}. If I make a change based on
your feedback, I will add you to the contributor list (unless you ask to
be omitted).
