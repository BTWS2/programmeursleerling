At this point in the book, everything that you really need to know to be
an accomplished Python programmer – or maybe even an accomplished
programmer in general – has been covered. I want to quickly highlight a
few useful modules that do not need a chapter of their own. I will not
give many details; once you know what the purpose of a module is, you
can look up more information on it in the Python reference.
