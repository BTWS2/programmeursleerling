Create a program that asks the user
for numbers, until the user enters zero. It then prints the mean,
median, and mode of these numbers. The `statistics` module can be used
for the mean and median; however, for the mode, print all those numbers
that have the highest count, even if that entails that you print more
than one number. By definition, for a number to be the mode it must
occur at least twice; so if every number only occurs once, there is no
mode. Hint: Consider using the `Counter` class to construct the mode.
