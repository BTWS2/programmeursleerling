Using a regular expression and the
`findall()` method, create a list of all the occurrences of the word
"the" a sentence. Print the number of items in the list. Your code
should handle the problem in a case-insensitive way. Make sure that you
do not count the letter combination "the" when it occurs as part of
another word (e.g., "thesaurus" or "ether").
