A person's full name consists of two
words, next to each other, consisting of only letters from the alphabet,
all lower case except for the first one, which is upper case. Between
the two words there should only be white spaces. The words start and end
at a word boundary. E.g., according to this specification Cardinal
Richelieu is a name, but Charles d'Artagnan is not, and neither is
Gilbert duPrez, Joe DiMaggio, or Unit X1138. Under this assumption, use
a regular expression to list all the two-word combinations in a sentence
which are probably names of persons.
