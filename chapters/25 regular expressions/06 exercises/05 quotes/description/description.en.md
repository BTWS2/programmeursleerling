When a person speaks, this is often represented in a piece of text by enclosing the spoken part within double quotes (`"`).

### Assignment

Write a function `quotes` that takes the location of a text file (`str`). The function must return a `list` containing all quotes in the given text file. A quote is a fragment of the text that is enclosed in double quotes.

### Example

In the following interactive session we assume the text file [`data.en.txt`](media/data/data.en.txt){:target="_blank"} to be located in the current directory.

```console?lang=python&prompt=>>>
>>> quotes('data.en.txt')
['Pythonesque']
```
