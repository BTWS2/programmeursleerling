The Grerory-Leibnitz series approximates pi
as $4 * (1/1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 ...)$. Write a function that
returns the approximation of pi according to this series. The function
gets one parameter, namely an integer that indicates how many of the
terms between the parentheses must be calculated.
