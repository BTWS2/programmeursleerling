A library contains books. Books have a
writer, identified by last name and first name. Books also have a title.
Books also have a location number that identifies where they can be
found in the library. Librarians want to be able to locate a specific
book if they know writer and title, and they want to be able to list all
the books that they have of a specific writer. What data structure would
you use to store the books?
