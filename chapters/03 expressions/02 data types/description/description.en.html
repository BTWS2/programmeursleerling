    <p>Finally, I can get to the topic of this chapter, which is "expressions".
      An expression is a combination of one or more values (such as strings,
      integers, or floats) using operators, which result in a new value. In
      other words, you can think of expressions as calculations.</p>
    <h3>Basic calculations</h3>
    <p>Basic calculations combine two values with one operator in between them.
      Some straightforward operators are:</p>
    <div class="dodona-centered-group">
      <table class="table table-striped table-condensed">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>operator</th>
            <th>description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><samp>+</samp></td>
            <td>addition</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><samp>-</samp></td>
            <td>subtraction</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><samp>*</samp></td>
            <td>multiplication</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><samp>/</samp></td>
            <td>division</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><samp>//</samp></td>
            <td>integer division</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><samp>**</samp></td>
            <td>power</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><samp>%</samp></td>
            <td>modulo</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>Here are some examples:</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span

<span class="go">3</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>I assume you know what each of these operators entails, except perhaps
      the integer division and modulo operators.</p>
    <p>The integer division (also called <i>floor division</i>) is simply a
      division that rounds down to a whole number. If you involve floats in the
      calculation, the result will still be a float, but rounded down. If you
      only involve integers in the calculation, the result will be an integer.</p>
    <p>The modulo operator (<samp>%</samp>) takes the remainder of a division.
      For example: If I divide 14 by 5, the result is 2.8, right? This means I
      can subtract 5 twice from 14, and still have a positive result, but if I
      subtract it a third time, the result will become negative. So, after
      subtracting 5 twice from 14 I have a remainder that is less than 5. This
      remainder is what the modulo operator produces.</p>
    <p>In very simplistic terms: if I have 14 cookies which I have to divide
      over 5 children, each child gets 2 cookies. And I still have 4 cookies
      left, because there are more children than I have cookies at that point.
      Thus, dividing 14 by 5 as an integer division is 2 (cookies per child),
      while 14 modulo 5 is the remainder 4 (cookies I have left in my hand).</p>
    <p>On a side note, I wish to point out that the code shown above consists of
      multiple lines. Each line is said to be a <i>statement</i>, and it
      consists of one command that Python executes (in the code above, a <samp>print()</samp>
      function on every line). Most programming languages make it mandatory to
      end each statement with a special character, usually a semi-colon (<samp>;</samp>).
      Python does not require a semi-colon after each statement, but each
      statement must (in general) be on its own line. In principle, you are
      allowed to place multiple Python statements on one line, but then you
      should put semi-colons between the statements. However, it is Python
      practice and convention not to do that, as it makes code ugly, hard to
      read, and difficult to maintain. So, please stick to the convention and
      give each statement its own line.</p>
    <h3>More complex calculations</h3>
    <p>You are allowed to combine operators into bigger calculations, just as
      you can do on the more advanced calculators. To help you out, you are also
      allowed to used parentheses in your calculations, and you can even nest
      these parentheses. Python will process the operators in the order
      prescribed by mathematicians, often referred to as PEMDAS (Parentheses,
      Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).</p>
    <p>Check out the calculation below, and try to predict what it will result
      in before you copy it to the Python shell and run the code.</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span
class="o">-</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">4</span><span
class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">9.0</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>There are a couple of things to note about this calculation.</p>
    <p>First, the end result is a float (even though it has no decimals, or, if
      you will, only zero as a decimal). The reason is that a division is part
      of the calculation, and for Python that means that it should turn this
      into a floating-point calculation.</p>
    <p>Second, just as explained above, spaces are ignored by Python, so the
      code above is the same as:</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span
class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span
class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">9.0</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>It is even the same as:</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span
class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">4</span>    <span
class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">9.0</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>I have been in long discussions with people who keep arguing that the
      code above should result in <samp>6.5</samp> or <samp>1.5</samp>,
      because <i>clearly</i> you have to calculate the <samp>5*2</samp> and
      the <samp>3+4</samp> before you do the subtraction and division. That is
      hogwash. It does not matter how close you place operands together, spaces
      are ignored. If you really want to calculate the <samp>3+4</samp> first,
      you have to put it between parentheses. You can then still use spaces to
      improve readability, but they mean nothing to Python.</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span

      <h4>Exercise</h4>
      <p>Now it is time to write your first program. Write a program that
        displays the number of seconds in a week. You should, of course, not
        grab your calculator or smartphone to do the calculation and then just
        print the resulting number, but you should do the calculation in Python
        code. Since this program needs only one line of code, you could just
        write it in the Python shell, though you are encouraged to create a
        program file and use that.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>String expressions</h3>
    <p>Some of the operators given above can also be used for strings, though
      not all of them.</p>
    <p>In particular, you can use the addition operator (<samp>+</samp>) to
      concatenate two strings, and you can use the multiplication operator (<samp>*</samp>)
      with a number and a string to create a string that contains a repetition
      of the original string. Check it out:</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="s2">"hello"</span><span class="o">+</span><span
class="s2">"world"</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">helloworld</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span
class="mi">3</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="s2">"hello"</span> <span
class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">hellohellohello</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span
class="s2">"goodbye"</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">3</span> <span
class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">goodbyegoodbyegoodbye</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>You cannot add a number to a string, or multiply two strings. Such use of
      the operators is undefined, and will give error messages. None of the
      other operators listed for numbers will work on strings either.</p>
    <h3>Type casting</h3>
    <p>Sometimes you need to change the data type of a value into a different
      data type. You can do that using type casting functions.</p>
    <p>I will discuss functions in a lot more detail in a later chapter, but for
      now you just need to know that a function has a name, and may have
      parameters (values) between parentheses after the name. It will do
      something with the parameters, and then may give back a result. For
      instance, the <samp>print()</samp> function displays the parameter values
      that are given to it between the parentheses, and gives nothing in return.</p>
    <p>The type casting functions take the parameter value between the
      parentheses and give back a value that is the (almost) the same as the
      parameter value, but of a different data type. The three main type casting
      functions are the following:</p>
    <div class="dodona-centered-group">
      <table class="table table-striped table-condensed">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>function</th>
            <th>description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><samp>int()</samp></td>
            <td>will return the value between the parentheses as an integer
              (rounding down if necessary)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><samp>float()</samp></td>
            <td>will return the value between the parentheses as a float (adding
              .0 if necessary)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><samp>str()</samp></td>
            <td>will return the value between the parentheses as a string</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>See the difference between the following two lines of code:</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span
class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">3.75</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span
class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="o">/</span><span
class="mi">4</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">3</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>Or the following two lines of code:</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span
class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">19</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span
class="nb">float</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span
class="o">+</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">19.0</span>
</pre></div>
    I stated that you cannot use the addition operator to concatenate a number
    to a string. However, if you need to do something like that, you can work
    around the issue by using string type casting:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="s2">"I own "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span
class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">15</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span
class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">" apples."</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">I own 15 apples.</span>
</pre></div>
