    <p>When something is wrong with your code, Python will raise errors. Often
      these will be <i>syntax errors</i> that signal that something is wrong
      with the form of your code (e.g., the code in the previous exercise raised
      a <samp>SyntaxError</samp>).</p>
    <p>There are also <i>runtime errors</i>, which signal that your code was in
      itself formally correct, but that something went wrong during the code's
      execution. A good example is the <samp>ZeroDivisionError</samp>, which
      indicates that you tried to divide a number by zero (which, as you may
      know, is not allowed). Try to make Python raise such a <samp>ZeroDivisionError</samp>.</p>
