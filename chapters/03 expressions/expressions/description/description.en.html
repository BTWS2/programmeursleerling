    <p>Before I can get to expressions, there is one more topic that requires
      some discussion, and that is data types. Specifically, there are three
      different data types that you need to be aware of at this time: <i>strings</i>,
      <i>integers</i>, and <i>floats</i>.</p>
    <h3>Strings</h3>
    <p>A string is a text, consisting of zero or more characters. In Python, a
      string is enclosed by either double quotes, or single quotes. In
      principle, it does not matter which of the two you use, i.e., <samp>"orange"</samp>
      is equivalent to <samp>'orange'</samp>. However, if you have a text which
      contains a single quote, if you want to avoid problems you will have to
      enclose it in double quotes, i.e., <samp>"I can't stand it"</samp> is a
      legal string, while <samp>'I can't stand it'</samp> is not. Vice versa
      for double quotes in a string, of course.</p>
    <p>What if a string contains both double quotes and single quotes? You can
      solve that issue by putting a backslash (<samp>\</samp>) in front of the
      single or double quote that is part of the string to tell Python to treat
      that single or double quote as a character of the string rather than
      something that ends the string, i.e., <samp>'I can\'t stand it'</samp> is
      a legal string. You can see that when you try to print it:</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'I can</span><span class="se">\'</span><span
class="s1">t stand it'</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">I can't stand it</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>But what if I want to put an actual backslash in a string, and that
      backslash is, by chance, in front of a single or double quote? Well, I can
      do the same thing for a backslash, namely put a backslash in front of a
      backslash to make it a literal backslash, rather than a backslash that
      changes the interpretation of the character that comes after it. For an
      example, check out what the next bit of code displays (you can type it
      into the Python shell).</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'I can</span><span class="se">\\\'</span><span
class="s1">t stand it'</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">I can\'t stand it</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>If this all is a bit confusing, forget about these details for now, as I
      will come back to them in a later chapter. For now, just remember that a
      string is a text, enclosed by either single or double quotes. A string
      might be of any length, including zero characters long.</p>
    <p>Be careful that you only use <i>straight</i> single or double quotes in
      your Python programs, and not <i>rounded</i> ones. Word processors are in
      the habit of changing your straight quotes into rounded quotes, and Python
      does not recognize those. Text editors will not do that, but should you,
      for some reason, copy code to and from a word processor, your quotes might
      get changed. Watch out for that.</p>
    <h3>Integers</h3>
    <p>Integers are whole numbers, which can be positive or negative (or zero).
      There is a certain maximum size that integers can become, which depends on
      the kind of computer and operating system you are running. For most
      purposes, however, you will not run into those boundaries. Python is not
      like those calculators with a 10-digit display that cannot use numbers
      higher than 10 billion.</p>
    <p>There are different ways of writing integers that result in the same
      value. <samp>1</samp> is the same as <samp>+1</samp> (there are other
      ways than these to write the value <samp>1</samp>, but these follow in a
      later chapter). So both <samp>print( 1 )</samp> and <samp>print( +1 )</samp>
      produce the same outcome. This is different for strings, of course. The
      string <samp>"1"</samp> is not the same as the string <samp>"+1"</samp>.</p>
    <p>When you use integers in Python, you cannot write them with <i>thousands
        separators</i> (commas in English) to make them more readable. I.e., the
      number one billion should be written as <samp>1000000000</samp> rather
      than <samp>1,000,000,000</samp>.</p>
    <p>Check out the following code and think about what it will display when
      you run it. Then copy it to the Python shell and run it.</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mo">000</span><span
class="p">,</span><span class="mo">000</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mo">000</span> <span
class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
    <div class="callout callout-info">
      <h4>Exercise</h4>
      <p>If your prediction of what this code would do was not correct, find out
        why it produces this result.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Floats</h3>
    <p>Floats, or <i>floating-point numbers</i>, are numbers with decimals. For
      instance, <samp>3.14159265</samp> is a float. Note that you have to use a
      period as the decimal separator. Many countries use a comma as the decimal
      separator, but Python uses the convention of English-speaking countries
      and uses the period.</p>
    <p>If there is an integer that for some reason you want to use as a float,
      you can do so by adding <samp>.0</samp> to it. I.e., <samp>13</samp> is
      an integer, while <samp>13.0</samp> is a float. Still, they represent the
      same value, and if you use Python to compare them (which I will get to in
      a short while), Python will tell you that they are the same value.</p>
    <p>Just like with integers, there are certain maximum boundaries for floats,
      and there is also a maximum precision. You are unlikely to ever reach
      those maximum boundaries, as Python will switch over to scientific
      notation when the numbers get very big, but if you use Python to do very
      precise calculations, you might run into problems with precision. That is
      unlikely to happen for most applications, but if you are a physicist whose
      calculations involve huge numbers of particles on the molecular or quantum
      level, it is something to be aware of.</p>
    <p>Note that due to the way that Python stores floats, certain numbers
      cannot be expressed exactly. For instance, the statement <samp>print(
        (431 / 100) * 100 )</samp> prints as answer <samp>430.99999999999994</samp>,
      and not <samp>431</samp> as you might expect. If you know that the
      outcome of a floating-point calculation must be an integer, then you best
      make sure that you round the outcome to the nearest whole number. You can
      use the <samp>round()</samp> function for that, which will be explained
      in Chapter \ref{ch:simplefunctions}.</p>
