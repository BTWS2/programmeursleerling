    <p>When you write an expression in the Python shell, and you run it, the
      result of the expression is shown below it. For instance, if you type the
      following command in the shell and press <i>Enter</i>, you see the result
      <samp>12</samp>.</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">5</span> <span
class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">7</span>
<span class="go">12</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>However, as I showed in Exercise \ref{python.shell}, a program that
      contains the statement <samp>5 + 7</samp> will not produce a result in
      the shell. Instead, you have to explicitly display everything that you
      want to see, even if it is on the last line of the program.</p>
    <p>So, even though this chapter is about expressions, the first thing I need
      to explain is not an expression, but a function, that allows you to
      display results. The function that does that is <samp>print</samp>. I
      already showed the <samp>print</samp> function in Chapters
      \ref{ch:introduction} and \ref{ch:usingpython}.</p>
    <p>The <samp>print</samp> function is used as follows: you write the word <samp>print</samp>,
      followed by an opening parenthesis, followed by whatever you want to
      display, followed by a closing parenthesis. For example (and I showed this
      one before):</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="s2">"Hello, world!"</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Hello, world!</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>If you run this code (by saving it into a Python file and running it in
      IDLE), you will see that it displays the text <samp>Hello, world!</samp>
      in the shell.</p>
    <p>By the way, when referring to a function by name in a text, authors of
      texts about programming often put an opening and closing parenthesis after
      the name of the function, to indicate that it is a function name. From now
      on, I will follow this convention. Moreover, instead of referring to a <i>function</i>,
      authors sometimes call it a <i>statement</i> or a <i>command</i>.
      However, these terms are usually used to refer to anything that Python can
      execute, not just functions. I.e., an expression can also be called a <i>command</i>.</p>
    <p>You can display multiple things with one <samp>print()</samp> function
      by putting everything that you want to display between the parentheses
      with commas in between. The <samp>print()</samp> function will then
      display all of the items, with one space in between each pair or them. For
      example:</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="s2">"Ik"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"heb"</span><span
class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"twee"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span
class="s2">"appels"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"en"</span><span
class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"een"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"banaan"</span> <span
class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Ik heb twee appels en een banaan</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>Note that the spaces in this statement are all superfluous. The
      statement:</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Ik"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"heb"</span><span
class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"twee"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"appels"</span><span
class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"en"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"een"</span><span
class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"banaan"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Ik heb twee appels en een banaan</span>
</pre></div>
    <p>is equivalent to the previous one. You can add such spaces for
      readability. You can even put spaces between the word <samp>print</samp>
      and the opening parenthesis, but by convention, for functions (and <samp>print()</samp>
      is a function), the opening parenthesis is placed against the function
      name.</p>
    <p>Note that you can not only use <samp>print()</samp> to display texts,
      but also to display numbers. You can even mix them up, as the following
      code shows.</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge">
      <pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span
class="p">(</span> <span class="s2">"Ik"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"heb"</span><span
class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"appels"</span><span
class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"en"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span
class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"banaan"</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Ik heb 2 appels en 1 banaan</span>
</pre></div>
