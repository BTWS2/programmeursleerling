Computers do not get bored. If you want the computer to repeat a certain
task hundreds of thousands of times, it does not protest. Humans hate
too much repetition. Therefore, repetitious tasks should be performed by
computers. All programming languages support repetitions. The general
class of programming constructs that allow the definition of repetitions
are called "iterations." A term which is even more common for such tasks
is "loops."

This chapter explains all you need to know about loops in Python.
Students who are completely new to programming often find loops the
first really hard topic in programming that they encounter. If that is
the case for you, then make sure you take your time for this chapter,
and work on it until you understand it completely. Loops are such a
basic concept in programming that you need to understand them in all
their details. Each and every chapter after this one needs loops.
