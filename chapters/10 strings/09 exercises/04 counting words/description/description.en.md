How often does a word appear in a text?

### Input

A line containing a word, followed by a line containing a text.

### Output

The number of occurrences of the word in the text. Capitals and lower case
letters may both be used, and you have to consider that the word
should be a separate word, and not part of another word.

> If you did the exercises from this chapter, you already developed a function
> that "cleans" a text. Combining that function with the `split()`
> function more or less solves the problem for you.
